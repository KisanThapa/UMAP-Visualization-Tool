# UMAP Visualization Tool

A web-based tool for visualizing UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) coordinates from CSV data, built with HTML, JavaScript, and Plotly.js. This tool allows users to upload CSV files containing UMAP coordinates, customize visualizations, and explore data interactively.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Upload CSV files containing UMAP coordinates and metadata.
- **Interactive Plots**: Visualize UMAP coordinates (X_umap1, X_umap2) with hover tooltips displaying cell barcodes and cluster information.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- No additional software or server setup requiredâ€”just open the `index.html` file in a browser.

## Data Format

The tool expects a CSV file with at least the following required columns:
- `X_umap1`: UMAP coordinate 1 (numeric).
- `X_umap2`: UMAP coordinate 2 (numeric).

Optional columns:
- `cell_barcode`: Unique identifier for each point (displayed on hover).
- `Cluster`: Cluster labels or any other column for coloring (can be numeric or categorical).
- Additional `X_pcaN` columns are ignored unless used for coloring.

### Example CSV

```csv
cell_barcode,X_pca1,X_pca2,X_pca3,X_umap1,X_umap2,Cluster
AAACATACACCGAT,3.954,-5.444,-2.829,8.115,-1.905,NNN
AAACATACAGAGAT,-3.408,7.240,-6.679,0.115,3.171,NNN
AAACATACCAGAAA,2.553,7.292,-8.084,0.134,4.114,NNN
AAACATACCACTGT,3.954,-5.444,-2.829,8.115,-1.905,NNN
```


- Rows with missing or malformed data will be skipped.
- Numeric columns (e.g., `X_umap1`, `X_umap2`) must contain valid numbers.

## Troubleshooting

- **File Not Loading**: Ensure the CSV has the required `X_umap1` and `X_umap2` columns and is properly formatted.
- **No Plot Displayed**: Check the browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors and verify your file structure.
- **Performance Issues**: For very large datasets (>10,000 points), consider downsampling your data for better performance.
